CHANGELOG

* 2014/08/30:

    - XChat is no longer supported, only HexChat is.

    - '/hexpaste paste ...' is now '/hexpaste file ...'.
      Rationale: if I ever implement pasting from the clipboard
      it will be named '/hexpaste clip ...'. Both are a paste operation
      so let's keep the names coherent.

    - '/hexpaste help' has been added. '/hexpaste' without parameters
      or with invalid parameters hint at the help.

* 2014/07/21:

    - Revised. Working on Python 3.4.1 and HexChat 2.10.0.
      No changes needed.

* 2013/10/01:

    - Revised for latest Python version.

* 2013/09/26:

    - Hexchat 2.9.6 is released. Bumped version and updated README.

* 2013/08/02:

    - Default speed to 2500.

    - Accept UTF-8 encoding with an optional BOM signature.

    - Show explicit errors while decoding.

    - Show an explicit error message on any unhandled Python exception.
      HexChat tends to just eat them without any message or traceback.

* 2013/07/27:

    - Print both the active network and channel on information messages.

* 2013/06/24:

    - Allow concurrent pastes in different contexts.

    - Port to Python 3 and HexChat. XChat no longer supported.

    - Remove '/hexpaste pause' in favor of using 'stop' to also pause
      when there are pending lines.

    - Replace empty lines with a single space to maintain
      separation between lines.
